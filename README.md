- Each time you type a word correctly, the word disappears and a popping sound happens.

## Features

- Let you know the number of errors made so far as your playing the game.
- The user has a rank according to their speed, e.g., speed <=20 is a newbie. 
- There is no time limit, but you will lose if you reach 15 errors
